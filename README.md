# Machine Learning Basics - Gradient Descent

This repository contains the implementation of basic machine learning concepts, focusing on **Gradient Descent**. The project uses Python along with libraries such as **NumPy**, **PyTorch**, and **Matplotlib** to demonstrate how gradient descent works, its mathematical foundation, and its application in training machine learning models.

## Course Overview

The content of this project is based on a **Udemy course** covering machine learning basics and the mathematical concepts needed for understanding and implementing algorithms like gradient descent. Key topics covered include:

- Linear algebra and calculus for machine learning
- Understanding the concept of gradient descent
- Implementing gradient descent in Python
- Visualizing the gradient descent process using Matplotlib

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Mathematical Foundation**
We start by exploring the mathematical concepts that are fundamental to gradient descent:
- **Differentiation**: Calculating derivatives to determine the direction of the steepest descent.
- **Loss Function**: Measuring how well the model's predictions align with the actual values.
- **Gradient**: The vector of partial derivatives that tells us how to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the loss function.

### 2. **Gradient Descent Algorithm**
- The **gradient descent** algorithm is used to find the minimum of a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the negative gradient. This is commonly used in training machine learning models to minimize the loss function.

### 3. **Implementation with Python**
Using **NumPy** for numerical operations, **PyTorch** for automatic differentiation, and **Matplotlib** for visualization, we implement gradient descent from scratch and experiment with simple linear regression models.

### 4. **Libraries Used**
- **NumPy**: Efficient array operations and linear algebra functions.
- **PyTorch**: For automatic differentiation and optimization.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizing the learning process.
